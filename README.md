### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**padilla410/padilla410** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a data scientist with the USGS Data Science Branch at US Geological Survey

Examples of my USGS work available on GitHub include:
* [lake-temperature-model-prep]()
* [lake-temperature-missouri-models]()

Exampels of my work under previous affilitations:
* [SWMPrExtension](https://github.com/NOAA-OCM/SWMPrExtension) - I served as project manager and technical lead on this project, leading a team of two staff. This was my initial entry into working with the [National Estuarine Research Reserve System](https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/). Working together we defined a series of data analyses and reporting templates that can be used to quickly develop custom annual status reports for each of the 29 reserves in the system.
* [SWMPrStorm](https://github.com/StormStories/SWMPrStorm) - I served as project manager and technical lead on this project, leading a team of three staff. I worked with the Southeast Atlantic NERRs to scope this work, and to develop and finalize this initial suite of data analyses. This project was "in progress" during my transition over to USGS, so the work was completed by Ben Crary, Amanda Flynn, and Shanna Rucker.
